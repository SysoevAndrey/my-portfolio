# Learn to learn project

###### 0.0.2

This is my first Yandex.Praktikum project. It is about learning approaches. It is a one page project builded on flex and grid with some animations.

Using techonologies: *HTML, CSS*.

The result is available by [link](https://sysoevandrey.github.io/learn-to-learn/).

Future plans: add adaptive design.
